# Tetrisâ„¢ by JEgamez

It is actually a clone version of the popular classic puzzle game TETRIS. It has a very clean and simple user interface, pastel colored blocks and control keys with adjustable starting levels up to 30 levels, great background music and sounds, and of course settings to do some tweaks.

> *This software is a forked version of Blockinger (open-source project) but in a completely isolated repository.*

# Note:
*I did not include the music .ogg files here because of the reason that the file size was too large to be uploaded in this repository but I will provide a link below for the music.*
